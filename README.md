# Chess by Breaker
 I made a little chess game, which contains all rules, but the castling to the queens side. It allows for several camera following options and splitscreen. You can play with AI or another local player. Also AI vs AI is fun. Might be that WebGl is too slow for AI. AI is not smart. It just calculate 4 turns and evaluates the beaten figures.
